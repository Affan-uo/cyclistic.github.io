This is a data analysis case study for the Google Data Analytics course. The essence of this project is to perform a real-world task of a junior data analyst.I am imagining that I am working for Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago .The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,my team wants to understand how customers and subscribers use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights,my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert customers into snbscribers. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
